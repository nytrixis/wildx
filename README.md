Our Wildlife Awareness and Conservation Project is a unique initiative designed to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation for wildlife among children while also addressing the practical challenges of wildlife monitoring and management. This project combines education, technology, and conservation efforts to create a comprehensive platform that serves both as a learning tool and a protective measure for wildlife and agricultural areas.

#### *Project Highlights*

- *Wildlife Monitoring & Anti-Intrusion:* Leveraging cutting-edge technology like the Teachable Machine for real-time wildlife identification. This feature plays a crucial role in preventing potential conflicts by allowing users to monitor and scare off dangerous animals like bears and elephants, as well as agricultural pests like pigs and birds. In addition, the system uses loud noises to deter animals from entering restricted areas, ensuring both human safety and the protection of animals.

- *Educational Games:* Engaging children through interactive games, including jigsaw puzzles featuring stunning wildlife images and quizzes that challenge their knowledge about different animal species. These activities are designed to be both fun and educational, helping kids grow up with a strong connection to the natural world.

- *Incident Reporting:* A user-friendly report form enables community members to submit wildlife incident reports, complete with location mapping powered by Leaflet. This helps in creating a comprehensive database of wildlife activity, aiding conservation efforts and ensuring that timely actions can be taken to protect both people and animals.

- *Wildlife Encyclopedia:* A rich repository of information about various species, tailored for young minds. This feature ensures that children not only play and learn but also develop a lifelong appreciation for the importance of wildlife conservation.
